# Results

This folder stores outputs generated by experiments.

## Structure
- `tables/` — CSV summaries and per-fold metrics
- `figures/` — plots and visualisations (e.g., slice figures)
- `models/` — saved checkpoints (typically not committed to GitHub)

## Expected outputs
When running CV scripts (e.g., `src/*/scripts/run_cv.py`) you should see:
- `results/tables/<method>_<tag>_cv_summary.csv`
- `results/tables/<method>_<tag>_cv_folds.csv`

When running the experiment runner:
- `results/tables/compare_<tag>.csv`

When running dense visualisation scripts:
- `results/figures/<tag>_*.png`

## Notes
This folder may be empty in a fresh clone. Generate results by running the scripts in `src/*/scripts/` or via `experiments/run_experiments.py`.
